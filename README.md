## About ðŸ“–

EnchantedBookLib is a both Fabric and NeoForge library mod which tries to make multiplatform just a bit easier (and mostly for my mods).

This mod doesn't add anything on its own.

The main features of this library:
- Registry API
- Networking API
- Events (collection is currently small)
- Collections of some tags
- JSON5 config API
- Some other utilities
